My solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in C#.

On most AoC days I try to develop a solution as fast as possible to measure my coding puzzle skills
against everyone else. But I also like to write examples of good [clean code]([https://](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/)),
to inspire other coders (and myself) to make the world a little bit better by writing code that others
are not afraid to touch. We already have too much of that kind of code.

So this year I'm using Advent of Code to show that as a coder you can explicitly choose
in what *mode* you're writing code:

- **fast**: where you're writing one-off code that is only focussed on getting a short-term result,
- **clean**: where you're writing code that will live for a long time and will be changed by others (which includes yourself in three months!).

I enjoy writing in both modes. Normally I don't show the results of my fast mode to anyone, but
this year I'll make an exception. Read it and weep (or better: learn).

Note: I'm not pretending to be a master of clean code. Every code, no matter how clean, can be improved.
I'm trying my best and I'm open to suggestions to make it even cleaner. Please use the
[issues page](https://github.com/samegens/aoc-2023/issues) to make suggestions.
